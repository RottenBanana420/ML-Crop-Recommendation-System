# Reports Directory

This directory contains generated reports and build artifacts.

## Contents

- `.coverage` - Coverage data file generated by pytest-cov
- `htmlcov/` - HTML coverage report (open `htmlcov/index.html` in a browser to view)

## Generating Reports

### Test Coverage Report

To generate a fresh coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term
```

This will:
1. Run all tests with coverage tracking
2. Generate an HTML report in `reports/htmlcov/`
3. Display a summary in the terminal

### Viewing HTML Coverage Report

```bash
open reports/htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
# or
xdg-open reports/htmlcov/index.html  # Linux
```

## Note

This directory is excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`). Reports are generated locally and should not be committed to the repository.
